Letâ€™s create a file to automate the required environment variables configuration
vi /etc/profile.d/sonar-scanner.sh

Here is the sonar-scanner.sh file content.
#/bin/bash
export PATH="$PATH:/opt/sonar-scanner/bin"

Reboot your computer or use the source command to add the sonar scanner command to the PATH variable.
reboot
source /etc/profile.d/sonar-scanner.sh

Use the following command to verify if the PATH variable was changed as expected.
env | grep PATH

Here is the command output:
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin:/opt/sonar-scanner/bin
In our example, the /opt/sonar-scanner/bin directory was added to the PATH variable.

Use the following to verify the Sonarqube scanner version installed.
sonar-scanner -v
